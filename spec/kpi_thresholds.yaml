# spec/kpi_thresholds.yaml
# Defines the pass/fail criteria for automated rule validation.

# --- Effectiveness Gates ---
# Maximum allowed False Positive (FP) rate during synthetic testing.
# 5% is a strict but good starting point.
fp_rate_max: 0.05

# --- Performance Gates ---
# Maximum 95th percentile evaluation latency per 1000 events.
# This ensures the rule is fast even on outlier events.
p95_latency_ms_max: 50

# Maximum average CPU usage percentage a rule can consume during a benchmark.
cpu_percent_max: 10.0

# --- Release Safety Gates ---
# The maximum allowable increase in FP rate compared to the last stable version.
# If a new version's FP rate is old_fp + 0.02, trigger a rollback.
fp_regression_threshold: 0.02
